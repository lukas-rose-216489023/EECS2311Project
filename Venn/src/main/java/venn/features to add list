Stakeholder requirements:

1. 	Each text box is just a placeholder for the real text. In other words a textbox is just a title and there 
	could be other text that needs to be accessed.
   
2. 	The application must support a compare feature where user can compare current diagram with a saved diagram. 
	The items to be compared can be anthing; the stakeholder is flexible. This can be done either visually or 
	via text.
