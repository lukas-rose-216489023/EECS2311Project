Stakeholder requirements added on March 3!

1. Each element in the Venn diagram may have a longer description that is by default hidden, 
   but the user must be able to display it.
   
2. The app must support a mode where the user is asked to arrange a set of tags on the Venn diagram.
   Once finished, the user can compare their arrangement to a previously hidden correct answer
