Stakeholder requirements:

1. Each textbox is just a placeholder for the real text. In other words a textbox is just a title and there could be other text that needs to be accessed.
   
2. The app must support a compare feature where user can compare current diagram with a saved diagram.

   
   Questions:
   
   What will the text be in 1.?
   ans.
   
   What exactly needs to be compared in specific? Title, text, color, position?
