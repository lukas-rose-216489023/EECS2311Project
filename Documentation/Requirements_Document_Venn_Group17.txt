1.	System Purpose
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The purpose of the Venn Diagram Visual Tool is to allow users to organize their information visually into three 
	categories, consisting of sections of two circles and a section where the two circles overlap another. Users are
	able to see the relationships between the sets of information and identify similarities and differences.
	
	All essential features of the system are described in this document.

3.	Acceptance Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Acceptance Requirements met by the Venn Diagram Visual Tool.


	- User interface includes a two-circle Venn diagram visual with a title, and subtitles above each circle

	- Texts of titles are editable to user
	
	- Venn Diagram allows user to add Text Boxes into three separate conjunctions

	- Text boxes can be put in fixed places or according to the user's preference and the options can be toggled
	
	- The user interface includes a text adder window, located in the top left corner 

	- Buttons and text fields in the text adder will allow the user to do the following:

		- 'textbox name' text field
			- Allows users to add a name/title to the textbox to be created
		
		- green round '+' button
			- Allows user to create a new text box to the left side of the user interface which will then
			   be available for dragging into the diagram sets
			- This button is also replacable with the 'Enter' key when the user is selecting the 'textbox name' text field
			   
		- 'Box Color'
			- Gives user ability to change the color of the textbox to be created 

		- 'Font Color'
			- Gives user ability to change the color of the text  in the textbox to be created

		- 'More' / 'Less' button
			- Allows user to expand and shrink the text adder window to reveal or hide the extra information text field
		 
		- 'Extra information' text field
			- Allows users to add extra information attached to the textbox to be created


	- The textboxes created will allow the user to do the following when hovered over with mouse:
	
		- 'Text Edit'
			- Allows user to edit the textbox name of the textbox hovered over

		- 'Box Color'
			- Gives user ability to change the color of the textbox hovered over

		- 'Font Color'
			- Gives user ability to change the color of the text  in the textbox hovered over

		- 'Trashcan'
			- Gives user ability to discard the textbox hovered over
		

	- The user interface includes  right side panel of oparates icons which expands when hovered over with mouse

	- Buttons in the right side panel will allow the user to do the following:

		- 'Anchoring'	
			- Allows user to turn anchoring on and off	
				- When anchoring is on, text boxes will move to preprogrammed positions when dragged within the circles and
			    	  the screen will stay maximized. This also means only a fixed amount of text boxes can be dragged into each 
				  region.	
				- When anchoring is off, text boxes can be dragged anywhere the user prefers and the screen can be resized
				   according to the user's preference

		- 'Screenshot'	
			- Lets users save a screenshot image, default in .png file format, of the diagram which will be saved in the directory from 
			   where the program was run or of users choice

		- 'Reset'
			- Allows users to clear all user action and reset the application to it's default state

		- 'Import'
			- Allows users to open and load an exisiting venn diagram project file

		- 'Export'
			- User can save the project process in a text file which can then be opened again through the 'Import' function 	
				
		- 'Undo'
			- Lets user undo their latest action in the application window

		- 'Redo'
			- Lets user redo their latest redo action in the application window

		- 'Compare'
			- Allows users to compare two different venn diagram projects in these aspects:
				- Comparing title of the diagram
				- Comparing circle titles 
				- Comparing textbox texts
				- Comparing textbox positions (left, right, centre)

		- 'Right Circle Color' 
			- Gives user ability to change the color the right circle of the diagram

		- 'Left Circle Color' 
			- Gives user ability to change the color the left circle of the diagram

		- 'Background Color'
			- Gives user ability to change color of the background of the application

		- 'Button Color'
			- Gives user ability to change color of the buttons in the application

		- 'Text Adder Background' 
			- Gives user ability to change color of the text adder, located in the left top corner,
		                     background


	- Text boxes are held either in the section it is dropped into by user, or the preprogrammed positions depending on whether 
	  anchoring is on or off.
  
	- Text boxes exist in a list on the left side of the interface prior to dragging into diagram.

	- The different circles have the same radius.

	- The circles have a set radius (depending on the screen size).
